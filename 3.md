 WOW! This is GOLD! 🏆 Let me analyze your qualitative notes carefully...

  📊 Key Insights from Your Analysis:

  Overall Scores:

  - Exp9a1 (chunk 500): Success rate 56% (17/30 queries)
  - Exp9a2 (chunk 700): Success rate 52% (16/30 queries)
  - Winner: Exp9a1 by +4% quality! ✅

  Critical Patterns I See:

  1. Chunk 500 (Exp9a1) WINS on:

  - Precision cases (gets exactly what's needed, nothing more)
  - Specific queries (e.g., "Email CS" - gets just contact info)
  - Examples:
    - ecom_easy_005 (Nomor CS): A1=1.0, A2=0.0 (A2 retrieved too much!)
    - ecom_easy_010 (Pre-Order): A1=0.5, A2=0.0 (A1 closer)
    - ecom_easy_011 (Transaksi aman): A1=1.0, A2=0.8

  2. Chunk 700 (Exp9a2) WINS on:

  - Complete procedural content (step-by-step guides)
  - Context-heavy queries (need full procedures)
  - Examples:
    - ecom_easy_002 (Batas waktu return): A1=0 (incomplete), A2=1.0 ✅
    - ecom_easy_004 (Refund time): A1=1.0 BUT you noted "retrieved troubleshooting wrongly" - A2 got right doc
    - ecom_medium_001 (Return penjual tidak respon): A1=1.0, A2=1.0 (both same)

  3. Both FAIL on "Tough Questions":

  Your notes: "tough question, mungkin butuh semacam metode untuk bisa paraphrase gitu"
  - ecom_easy_009: "Paket 10 hari belum sampai" → Both score 0-0.5
  - ecom_easy_014: "Email CS" → Both struggle (need paraphrase/semantic understanding)
  - ecom_edge_001: "gmna cra retrn" (typos) → A1=1.0, A2=-0.667 (!!)

  ---
  Your Key Observations:

  "Prosedural, kurang lengkap" (appears 2x):

  - ecom_easy_001: A1 gives incomplete procedure
  - ecom_medium_005: Both A1 & A2 give incomplete tukar ukuran process
  - Insight: Chunk 500 cuts procedural steps mid-way

  "Meleset dikit" (appears multiple times):

  - ecom_easy_015: "meleset dikit dibawah"
  - ecom_medium_007: "Meleset dikit, sekitar dua poin diatas nya"
  - Insight: Reranker still has subsection precision issues (Phase 8A problem persists!)

  "Perhaps need require real CS" / "Advanced question":

  - ecom_hard_001, ecom_hard_002: Both need human judgment
  - Insight: Some queries beyond RAG capability (edge cases, policy interpretation)

  "Tough question, need paraphrase":

  - Typo queries (gmna cra, cs ny gmn)
  - Semantic queries ("Email CS apa ya?")
  - Insight: Need query preprocessing / normalization!

  Quantitative & Qualitative Alignment:

  | Metric            | Exp9a1 (500) | Exp9a2 (700) | Winner     |
  |-------------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
  | Precision (quant) | 0.828        | 0.778        | A1 (+5.0%) |
  | Quality (qual)    | 56%          | 52%          | A1 (+4%)   |

  NO MISMATCH - Exp9a1 wins on BOTH metrics! ✅

  Key insight:
  - Chunk 700 performs WORSE with reranker (0.778 vs baseline 0.783)
  - Larger chunks confuse both embeddings AND reranker
  - More noise = harder for cross-encoder to distinguish relevance
  - Chunk 500 is optimal size for reranker performance

  This validates Phase 8A finding: "Meleset sedikit" still happens with reranker!

  ---
  Game-Changing Insights:

  1. Chunk 500 is optimal for reranker:
    - Chunk 500: Better precision (0.828) AND better quality (56%)
    - Chunk 700: WORSE performance (0.778) despite more context
    - Reranker works best with focused, smaller chunks!
  2. Reranker doesn't fix "meleset sedikit":
    - Still rank wrong subsections higher
    - Need better chunking strategy (semantic boundaries)
  3. Query preprocessing CRITICAL:
    - Typo queries fail hard
    - Semantic paraphrase needed ("Email CS" vs "cs@tokopedia.com")
  4. "Tough questions" = Phase 10 territory:
    - Need query expansion
    - Need multi-hop reasoning
    - Some need real human CS

  🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Based on Your Analysis):

  Priority 1: Accept Exp9a1 (chunk 500 + reranker) as production config ✅
  - Precision 0.828 (exceeds 0.80 target by +2.8%)
  - Quality 56% > 52% (better than chunk 700)
  - Wins on BOTH quantitative AND qualitative metrics
  - Perfect 1.000 precision on hard queries

  Priority 2: Address "meleset sedikit" with:
  - Query preprocessing (normalize typos, expand synonyms)
  - Better chunking (semantic boundaries, not character count)
  - Hybrid search BM25 (keyword match for exact terms)

  Priority 3: Tag "tough questions" for human escalation
  - Queries with ambiguity/edge cases
  - Advanced policy interpretation
  - Out-of-scope detection
